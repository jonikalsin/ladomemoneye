We’ve already discussed Debbie’s parents William Petry and Faith Petry in another article <a href=#>here</a>. Debra is one of the three children born to her parents. Her two siblings are; Patricia Petry and William Petry Jr. When Debbie spoke with Winter Park Magazine she called her parents “the golden ticket when it comes to parents.”</p><p>Debbie lost her father in 2014 and her mother died in 2019.</p><p>In the preview, Debbie grabbed everyone’s attention when she shared what if her daughter Amanda was the one with over $10 million in net worth.

Holly’s contact with the gaming industry gave birth to the idea and launched the game.</p><p>Debbie also works with her daughters Jenna (meditation teacher) and Amanda (product design). Her ultimate goal with the business is to open up healing centers where children can go to learn Qigong (Meditation). She also wants to create a place where adults can also go to learn Qigong and go back and be teachers in their home locations.</p><p>The video game was more than a business for her.
