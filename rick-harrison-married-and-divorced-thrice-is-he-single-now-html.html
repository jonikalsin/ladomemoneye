Known as “The Spotter,” by the other cast members, he is the current owner of the pawnshop.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>While many people are familiar with his work because of the show, his personal life, especially his love life, is not always highlighted. For fans wondering “Who is Rick Harrison married to,” here is a breakdown of Harrison’s love life.&nbsp;</p><h2>Rick Harrison’s Third Wife</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In July 2013, Harrison tied the knot for the third time with Deanna Burditt, who was also marrying for the third time in Laguna Beach.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The couple had gotten engaged in 2012 on Valentine’s Day.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a>, the couple exchanged their vows traditionally in front of 180 guests, but there were also fun, non-traditional elements in their wedding. First off, his co-star Chumlee was the ring bearer, and&nbsp;Counting Cars&nbsp;star Danny Koker officiated as the minister. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Following the nuptials, a rock band called Steel Panther entertained the guests, after which they even went home with party favors, which was a bobblehead of the duo in their wedding attire.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But on October 16, 2021, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ</a> reported the couple had quietly divorced a year ago.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>According to legal documents, Harrison filed for divorce on July 1, 2020, almost seven years after their wedding. In the papers, Harisson stated that the husband and wife had grown apart during their marriage because their “tastes, mental dispositions, views, likes, and dislikes [had] become so divergent.”</p><p>This made their marriage incompatible, and there was no hope for reconciliation.&nbsp;</p><p>His wife initially asked for alimony, but according to the documents, the former couple settled on an agreement in September 2020 after finalizing all critical issues.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Rick Harrison’s Previous Marriages</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Before Burditt, Harrison was married twice.&nbsp;</p><p>He was first married to Kim Harrison from 1982 until 1985, and they share sons Corey, 37, and Adam, 36. Corey helps Harrison run their pawnshop and is one of the stars in the History channel series.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, he married Tracy Harrison, and their union lasted over 20 years until their divorce in 2011, the same year he met his third wife, whom he married two years later. With Tracy, Harrison shares son Jake.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Harrison is also a stepfather to Burditt’s three daughters from her previous marriages.&nbsp;</p><p>As of right now, Harrison appears to be single, but no one knows for sure as he could keep his relationship on the down-low if he has one.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKqZmLhutMCrqaKrn6N6rq3Rq6CenF2Wu6V5w6KtqKqTmrFuwMeroJydXZ7AbrTEZqqippehsm66zrBloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-walker-last-photo-death-smiling.html><span>←</span><span>Paul Walkers Last Photo Smiling Before His Tragic Death Hollywood Life</span></a>
