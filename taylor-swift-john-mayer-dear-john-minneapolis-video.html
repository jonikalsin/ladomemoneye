The songwriting heavy album includes songs “Mean,” “Sparks Fly,” and the unforgettable six minute and 43 second track “Dear John” — one of the very few times Taylor has named an ex in a song. The track was inspired by the exes short-lived relationship that occurred when she was 19 and he was 32. They began dating in 2009 when they collaborated on his track “Half Of My Heart” off Battle Studies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-swift-dear-john-mayer-eras-tour-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Dear John” is a less-than-favorable take on the relationship, where a young Taylor calls him out for being “played” by his “dark twisted games.” She sings, “Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong / Don’t you think 19 is too young / To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so? / I should’ve known.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Taylor last played the ballad in Auckland, New Zealand back in March 2012 during the Speak Now World Tour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-swift-dear-john-mayer-eras-tour-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>At the time, John didn’t seem thrilled with the track — calling it “cheap songwriting” in an interview with&nbsp;Rolling Stone. “I know she’s the biggest thing in the world, and I’m not trying to sink anybody’s ship, but I think it’s abusing your talent to rub your hands together and go, ‘Wait till he gets a load of this!’ That’s bull—-,” he said at the time. “It was a really lousy thing to do…I never got an email. I never got a phone call. I was really caught off guard,” John added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>He later seemed to reply to the track on “Paper Doll” which lyrics like “You’re like 22 girls in one / And none of them know what they’re running from” — a reference to her&nbsp;Red&nbsp;track “22.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>By 2021, however, John seemed to be at peace with the song. “Sometimes, I hope it’s about me. Sometimes, it’s a really good song,” <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he said to <strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> generally about break-up tracks that could be about him — including Taylor’s obvious one. “I don’t think it’s a dirty admission. Sometimes, a song is so good, I go, ‘Man, I hope that’s about me.’ … I’ll check everyone’s music out. I’m a fan.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>The July 7 re-release of&nbsp;Speak Now&nbsp;features a now 33-year-old Taylor on the cover in a tulle purple dress, a grown-up take of the original dress she wore for the album art.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5FuZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2fvKm6jKaYsp2iYrGmrdFmoaignmK6qrrNnpipp5yewG7CyJ2cqGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jon-peters.html><span>←</span><span>Jon Peters Net Worth 2023: A Real Time Update On Jon Peters Life!</span></a>
