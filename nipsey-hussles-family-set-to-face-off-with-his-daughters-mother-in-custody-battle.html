Tanisha Foster is presently fighting for guardianship of her daughter, Emani, with Nipsey.</p><p>According to court documents obtained by <a href=# rel=noopener>RadarOnline.com</a>,</p><p>“Nipsey’s brother Sam — along with his sister Samantha and mother Angelique – have informed the court they scheduled mediation with Tanisha for November 30. Nipsey’s estate has agreed to cover the costs of the session.”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>legal documents</a>, “Mediation may result in a settlement of the matter that is the subject of the above-referenced case and of any and all interested persons’ and parties’ interests therein. Settlement of the matter may result in an agreement for the distribution of assets of the Estate of Ermias Asghedom, however those interests may be held. Settlement of the matter may also result in an award of attorney’s fees to one or more parties.”</p><p>Nipsey Hussle was murdered outside of his clothing store in 2019. The recording artist left behind two children, Emani and Kross, who are both set to receive a portion f his $8 million estate. Kross’ mom, Lauren London, will receive her son’s inheritance on his behalf. Nipsey’s family will keep his daughter’s portion of inheritance as they presently have guardianship of Emani.</p><p>Tanisha expressed her desire to once again <a href=# rel=noopener>regain guardianship</a> of her daughter with Nipsey Hussle after the rapper untimely passing. Hussle’s family, however, rushed to stop her from legally obtaining guardianship after proving to the courts that Tanisha was unfit to care for her daughter.</p><p>Foster accused <a href=# rel=noopener>Nipsey’s family</a> of “using their financial position and influence to disregard their priorities by controlling the desires of Emani and Tanisha by withholding financial assistance and reducing visitation.” She also accused the family of her daughter’s father of favoring Lauren London over her.</p><p>Despite previously being shut out from legal guardianship, Tanisha Foster plans to continue her fight in the court system.</p><p>Photo: Tanisha Foster/Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWtmamlfZoJwusipqp6xXZ3CtL%2FLnqpmnpGitq3FjKycrWWkpHqnrcKeZKielmLEqsDHZp%2Biq12Zrrazx62cq6tdory1tMSrZKKmXZjCtMDOnbBmmpGpwa2xjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hippopotas-evolving-skies-84.html><span>←</span><span>Hippopotas (Evolving Skies 84) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
