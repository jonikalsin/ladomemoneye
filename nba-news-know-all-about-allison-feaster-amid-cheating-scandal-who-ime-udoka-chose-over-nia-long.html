<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Know all about Allison Feaster amid Cheating Scandal: Who Ime Udoka chose over Nia Long</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Ime Udoka</strong> is all over the NBA headlines as at the moment he’s the biggest controversial name in the league. As after leading the young Boston Celtics team to the NBA Finals and changing the whole story around the franchise in his first season as the head coach itself. Recently, a scandal of his was caught and a sad and dirty reality about Ime Udoka was revealed. As he cheated on his fiance <strong>Nia Long </strong>with a Celtics female staff member. No names were out but maybe the fans and many reports around have guessed it all as they point out at <strong>Allison Feaster</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nia-Long-and-Ime-Udoka-1024x682.jpg><p>As reported by, Shams Charania head coach Ime Udoka has violated the franchise’s code of conduct by maintaining an improper, intimate and consensual relationship with a female staff member. As the insider, in a tweet of his revealing it all wrote: “Celtics coach Ime Udoka had an improper intimate and consensual relationship with a female member of the team staff, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium. It’s been deemed a violation of franchise’s code of conduct.” The Insider said it all out and loud but didn’t mention the name of the female staff member and the reason for it is very obvious. &nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Still, fans are doing what they always do and are linking up Ime Udoka’s scandal where Nia Long got cheated with Allison Feaster. Allison Feaster is a part of the Boston Celtics since January 2020 and she as of now serves as Vice President of Player Development and Organizational Growth. And, the resume she has got herself by balling out for a decade and more is proving her position to be right.</p><p>Allison Feaster is 46 years old and has suited up in the WNBA for a decade and has also played in other international leagues. She was a solid forward and had a great basketball IQ while helping the three teams she played for. And, she continues to do the same for the Boston Celtics, unlike Ime Udoka who now stands suspended. Being the Vice President of Players Development… She was closely working with Ime Udoka as he was the head coach. So the fans linking them together and throwing shade on Allison Feaster is understandable. But they aren’t just involving her and now have come up with other female staffers as well which just scraps it all. As it’s just a fan-based theory.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=#>“30 Russian women and 10 Bentleys” Vladimir Putin made Dennis Rodman speechless with his impeccable hospitality</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did Allison Feaster and Ime Udoka cheat on Nia Long?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Adobe_Express_20220923_1918430_1-1024x576.jpg><p>Ime Udoka has surely cheated on Nia Long and there’s no doubt about it. But Allison Feaster is pure, clean and completely out of the topic. As Marc J. Spears recently backed her up and tweeted: “For those speculating and curious about the Celtics’ situation, Vice-President of Player Development and Organizational Growth Allison Feaster is not involved in this.”</p><p>Allison Feaster is married to her long time date Danny Strong and deserves an apology from the fans for linking her to the dirty and unloyal actions of Ime Udoka. But now it’s all clear and her reputation is back. But there are no front runners for the other cheater spot yet. But as time passes by things will be revealed as many believe the league is still hiding something.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>For those speculating and curious about the Celtics' situation, Vice-President of Player Development and Organizational Growth Allison Feaster is not involved in this.</p>— Marc J.
