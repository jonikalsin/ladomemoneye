Before May had to leave, Bulbasaur decided to stay with her.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=AG074>Hokey Poké Balls!</a></i>, May sent out Bulbasaur to enjoy the sights as they went through a city. Bulbasaur quickly got distracted by some flowers in a truck and had to be rescued as the truck sped off. Later, at the Pokémon Center, May showed Professor Oak her Bulbasaur, which made Ash decide to bring his own <a href=# title="Ash's Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> over for a visit. When the Poké Ball arrived, it wouldn't open, making everyone believe that the Pokémon Center's Balls were stolen. The culprits were revealed to be <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a>, who accidentally dropped Ash's Bulbasaur while escaping. The two Bulbasaur teamed up to stop Team Rocket. Once they found Team Rocket, the two Bulbasaur battled them, with Ash's Bulbasaur protecting and teaching May's how to fight. After rescuing the Pokémon, Professor Oak called back and asked for Ash's Bulbasaur to return so it could stop the <a href=# title="Water (type)">Water</a> and <a href=# title="Grass (type)">Grass</a> Pokémon from fighting.
