Dann. On March 31, the band released a music video for the title tune (Ascension). The current album and song video follow the journey of leader Dann’s persona, whose narrative is said to be inspired by King Dangun of Korea. The seven-member Ascension ensemble loves the culture in all its majesty. The movie, which has the group and its agency, GF Entertainment, dressed in traditional attire throughout, even includes fight footage, hinting to a larger plot in the world established by the group and its agency.&nbsp;With their unique tale gradually capturing the attention of the globe, the septet was named first on Rolling Stone’s list of the 10 Best K-pop Debuts of 2021.</p><h2><span class="jss18187 jss18934"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~0~0 class="jss18189 jss18935">With&nbsp;</span><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~0~1 class="jss18189 jss18936">the&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss18187 jss18937"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~1~0 class="jss18189 jss18938">release&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss18187 jss18939"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~2~0 class="jss18189 jss18940">of&nbsp;</span><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~2~1 class="jss18189 jss18941">the&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss18187 jss18942"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~3~0 class="jss18189 jss18943">Ascension&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss18187 jss18944"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~4~0 class="jss18189 jss18945">music&nbsp;</span><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~4~1 class="jss18189 jss18946">video,&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss18187 jss18947"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~5~0 class="jss18189 jss18948">KINGDOM&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss18187 jss18949"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~6~0 class="jss18189 jss18950">makes&nbsp;</span><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~6~1 class="jss18189 jss18951">a&nbsp;</span><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~6~2 class="jss18189 jss18952">stunning&nbsp;</span></span><span class="jss18187 jss18953"><span id=editable-content-within-article~7~7~0 class="jss18189 jss18954">reappearance.</span></span></h2><p>On March 31, KINGDOM surprised its fans with a far more intense, dramatic, and exciting song video for their upcoming return album. The septet has built a name for itself by fusing ballads, pop, and hip-hop with traditional tunes.&nbsp;The music video for KINGDOM’s title single Ascension is another epic experience for fans. The video never loses focus and is ideally suited to the fictitious scenario in which sovereign countries compete for the crown.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/KINGDOM-2.jpg alt=KINGDOM width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>From traditional Korean instrumental music to traditional clothing, every component of the song video shouts out the group’s one-of-a-kind idea.&nbsp;Ascension centers on King Dann’s voyage and juxtaposes combat scenes with spring images in the palace. The video also teases the next monarch on whom the group will release their record – Louis.</p><h2>“It was worth the wait,” say fans of Ascension.</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ascension-MV-1.jpeg alt="Ascension MV" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The song video received favorable feedback from Kingmakers. They said it was worth the wait, given that the septet’s previous release was in October of last year. For fans who were used to the group releasing albums in a matter of months, four months felt excessive. The septet began in February of last year and will release three albums in 2021 alone.</p><p>The septet of GF Entertainment began with a never-before-seen idea of 7 Kings and 7 Kingdoms. Their CDs are built around a single King and his journey. Therefore each release is part of a larger picture. Meanwhile, during the 2021 Asia Artist Awards, the group received the Focus Award – Music, as well as the Next Generation Hallyu Star Award at the 2021 Newsis K-Expo.</p><p></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiioqaXmbyuecyaop6rXZZ6tLzEnKuam6WhrrN50Z6rrqqeYsSqwMdmq6GdXaeyrbHArJxmp5ZiwamxjJqqnJ2eqLawuoymrKyhk2LDqrDEqGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-colleges-look-at-sports-outside-of-a-school-team.html><span>←</span><span>Do colleges look at sports outside of a school team?</span></a>
