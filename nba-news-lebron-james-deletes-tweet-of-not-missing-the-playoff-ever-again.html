<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>LeGoat knows its over, LeBron James deletes tweet of not missing the playoff ever again</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Recall when <strong>LeBron James</strong> tweeted about the playoffs with the rest of us in the spring. He missed competing at that level and contending for the league’s top title, just like the other Lakers supporters.&nbsp;For the Lakers, things are going really horribly. Many of the team’s key players are struggling, <strong>Anthony Davis</strong> is injured, <strong>Russell Westbrook</strong> is still underperforming, and LeBron James is…deleting tweets?</p><p>Therefore, he vowed on Twitter that he would never again miss the playoffs. In actuality, these were his precise words: “I can/will NOT miss the postseason again for my career! This sh*t HURT. OK back to watching these games.” We did in fact verify that he indeed deleted the objectively funny tweet.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The tweet was quote-tweeted just after the Lakers’ Christmas Day loss to the Mavericks. So the tweet appears to have been deleted between that game and Tuesday afternoon.&nbsp;One fan wrote, “He knows they are not making as long as AD is out.” Some of the other reactions are mentioned below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>He knows they are not making as long as AD is out.</p>— Kaleb Earls (@K_Earls32) <a href=#>December 27, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Do y’all really expect a 38 year old to carry a team to the playoffs with no role players?</p>— Pablo M (@foeteenkaybaby) <a href=#>December 27, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Now let’s face it, Lebron can see which way the wind is blowing this season.

The Lakers were seven games below .500 and 2.5 games out of the play-in berth prior to their matchup with Orlando on Tuesday. They were also on the decline. It also happens to coincide with Anthony Davis’s prolonged absence from the Lakers. Without him, the group has often appeared adrift, especially on the court’s defensive end.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Skip Bayless denies all claims of Lakers wasting LeBron James’ ‘Years of Greatness’</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-can-lebron-james-s-lakers-still-make-the-playoffs><strong>Can LeBron James’s Lakers still make the playoffs?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/LeBron-1024x576.jpeg><p>There was scarcely a worse start for the Lakers this season than the one they had. They were put in a difficult situation right away, and the early stages of the new campaign saw a significant portion of their margin for error disappear.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anthony Davis’</a> injury seemed much more devastating than it already had and made the playoffs appear even further away. This season, the Lakers largely depended on both Davis and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LeBron James</a>, so losing one of them makes the fight much more difficult.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The Lakers might still contend for a postseason spot provided they can maintain their composure if AD’s injury is not serious, and if a trade is done to strengthen the squad or both. But there are a lot of “ifs” there. The next month or two might determine a significant portion of the Lakers’ playoff odds.</p><p>The team’s schedule is substantially lighter than it was earlier in the year, in particular. At this juncture, the Lakers cannot afford to tread water in a playoff race, so if they can put together a run during this time without AD, the postseason may become more plausible.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: LeBron James gets into a heated altercation with someone on the Magic bench</a></p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Russell Westbrook breaks all boundaries to establish himself as Triple-Double King</a></p><p><strong>Do follow us on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Google News</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZuYZqaVrMBuuMSbqaimXZ%2BurrHSZpuepJWpsrR507CcnqxdpLNuus6tZKaho6i2r7OMrZ%2BeZaChrrq7xZ9knq6Vp3qis8CipWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-jordan-hawkins-related-to-angel-reese.html><span>←</span><span>Is Jordan Hawkins Related To Angel Reese Are They Cousins?
