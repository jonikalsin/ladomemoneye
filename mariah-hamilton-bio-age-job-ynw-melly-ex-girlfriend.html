Mariah also made it to the cover of the mixtape and the name was tattooed above Melly’s left eyebrow however he got an X through it. After they had broken up he got it crossed out, he revealed this all in an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Power 105.1</a>.</p><p>On WORLDSTARHIPHOP, three days after the mixtape’s debut, YNW Melly released a music video for the song “Rack,” in which Melly and Mariah are seen messing about with paint at the location of the cover art shooting.</p><p>Mariah’s relationship with Melly ended in 2020.

Concerning the claimed video call the rapper made to his girlfriend on the day of the shooting, Melly’s ex-girlfriend’s mother was questioned. Falicia responded that she couldn’t recall what she had previously said about the incident or the rapper when asked if she had been truthful with the law enforcement officials who questioned her shortly after the crime took place.</p><p>Felicia stated when called to the stand that she didn’t feel comfortable discussing the incident but wouldn’t want to lie about it and wind up in jail. She is heard saying: “I’m saying what you want me to say” in the courtroom video that Law & Crime posted on its official YouTube page, and she asserted, “I do remember that they (police) bullied me and threatened my daughter.”</p><p>When Falicia was asked to identify Melly, who was sitting in the courtroom, she recognized him right away and grinned broadly at the rapper.
