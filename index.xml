子供から大人まで人気の桜井和寿さんですが、
実は子供が４人もいるビッグダディなのです！
２回の結婚経験のある桜井和寿さんですが、
現在の子供は、前の嫁さんとの間に１人、今の嫁さんとの間に３人と、
足して４人いるということになります。
あまりにメディアに登場しない桜井和寿さんですが、
子供の話自体もあまりしません。
離婚して再婚した当初は、
週刊誌にも子供のことも書かれていましたが、
今となっては、特にそこを突っ込む記事も少ないです。
現在の桜井和寿さんの子供と、
その子供の名前などを調べて見ました。
桜井和寿の４人の子供の名前（今嫁３人と元嫁１人）
桜井和寿さんは１９９４年に、
当時のバンドのマネージャーだった女性「ゆかり」さんと結婚、
同年に第一子の女の子が誕生しています。
桜井和寿さんの第１子の長女の名前は「優歌」です。
この長女はすでに大学を出てる年齢なので、
もしかしたら一緒には住んでいないかも？
地下アイドルの「桜井優香」という方が、
桜井和寿さんの長女と一文字違いということで、
「ミスチルの桜井さんの娘がアイドル？」と勘違いされる方もいたみたいです。（実際は全然違う方です）
桜井和寿さんの第２子は、離婚して吉野美佳さんと再婚した２０００年の翌年の、
２００１年６月に誕生しました。第２子は男の子で名前は「海音」（カイト）です。
その２年後の２００３年４月に第３子の男の子「愛音」（まなと）が誕生。さらに５年後の２００８年３月に第４子の男の子「奏音」（そら）が誕生。
今の嫁さんとの間に生まれた子供３人は、全員が男の子ということになりますね！
桜井和寿の歴代の嫁と子供の一覧 自分の文章ではちょっとわかりにくいので簡潔にまとめると、
１９９４年１０月 第１子「優歌（ゆうか）」女の子（元嫁のゆかりさん）
２００１年６月 第２子「海音（かいと）」男の子（現嫁の美佳さん）
２００３年４月 第３子「愛音（まなと）」男の子（現嫁の美佳さん）
２００８年３月 第４子「奏音（そら）」男の子（現嫁の美佳さん）
これが桜井和寿さんの子供の名前のすべてですね！
長男の海人くんは近頃メディアに出て有名になっています。
次男と三男も、そのうちメディアに出る日が来るかもしれません。
乃木坂４６に在籍していた桜井玲香は娘ではない。「きっかけ」カバーが噂の発端 一時期、桜井和寿さんの前嫁との娘が乃木坂で活躍しているとの噂がありましたが、あれはデマです。
ちなみに噂になったアイドルの子の名前は「桜井玲香」と名字以外、全然違います。
2016年のライブで桜井和寿さんが乃木坂の楽曲「きっかけ」をカバーしたことで、ネット上で間違った関連付けをされてしまい、そのような噂が出てしまったのです。
桜井和寿と吉野美佳の子供の学校は和光系列説が濃厚 桜井さんの子供が和光系列の幼稚園に通っているのは皆知っていると思いますが、中学や高校はどのような学校に進学しているのでしょうか？
B’zの稲葉さんの子供は青学系列でしたが、もしかしたら桜井さんの子供も、名門系列の学校に通われているのかもしれません。
きっと、勉強ができる場合は慶應か早稲田、まぁまぁなら法政か青学の中学・高校を受験しているのかな？と憶測します。
仮に全く勉強ができなかった場合は、そのままエスカレーターで和光系列に進学していることでしょう。幼稚園から知ってる友達と一緒なんて最高じゃないですか！
仮にサッカーの才能がある場合は、東京の帝京、神奈川の桐蔭学園などから推薦が来ると思いますが、それは確率的には低いですね・・・笑
2018年に成城に豪邸を建てたことで和光説が現実的に 桜井和寿さんと家族は長く田園調布に自宅を構えていましたが、2018年に成城に10億円の豪邸を建てています。
成城という土地は和光系列の学校の近所ということで、子供の通学の都合を考えて引っ越した可能性が高いです。
ちなみに浜田雅功さんの息子さんも和光系列に通い、自宅も成城学園付近にありました。
桜井和寿の長男・海音(Kaito )は強豪サッカーチームで活躍も辞めて父と同じ道へ 桜井さんは根っからサッカー好きで有名ですが、自分の子供たちもその影響を受けてるそうです。
再婚した美佳さんとの間に生まれた長男・海音（かいと）君は、Jリーグ名門クラブの下部組織で活躍していました。
海音くんが幼少期の頃は、サッカーチームの練習に桜井さんが顔を出したという目撃談もあります。
少年サッカーの会場にミスチルの桜井さんが子供の応援に現れたとしたら、めっちゃびっくりしますし、どう接して良いのかわかりませんね！笑
桜井和寿さんが仕事で子供とサッカーしていたことがありましたが、とても手慣れてて楽しそうでした。きっと普段一緒に遊んでる長男の海音くんのことを思い出して愛おしく思いながら遊んだことでしょう。
プロを目指してサッカーをプレーしていましたが、挫折を経験し、現在は父と同じ音楽の道に進みました。
長男・海音は現在はミュージシャン。父の名が重たくて「Kaito」から「海音」に改名？ サッカーの才能があった長男ですが、その後にサッカーで挫折してしまったそうです。
僕はずっと幼少期からサッカーをやっていて、中学2、3年生くらいまで11年間ほどはプロを目指してプレーしていました。その後、音楽を始めたり、違う方向が見つかったりと、サッカーから離れる時期がありました。そこからはフットサルなどを仲間内でエンジョイでやるようになりました。今ではオフの日はずっとフットサルをやっていますね。
その後に音楽に目覚め、ドラムは始め、今では「インナージャーニー」というバンドでドラムとして所属しています。</description></item><item><title>Angelica Castro</title><link>/angelica-castro.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/angelica-castro.html</guid><description>Learn about Angelica Castro Net Worth, Biography, Age, Birthday, Height, Early Life, Family, Dating, Partner, Wiki and Facts.

現在の嫁である森下愛子さんとは結婚して30年以上経つおしどり夫婦ですが、今の嫁さんにたどり着くまでにかなりの遠回りをしてます。
吉田拓郎さんは1972年の26歳の頃に最初の結婚をします。
初婚から幾度も離婚を繰り返して、今の奥さんと再婚して、ようやく落ち着いたのです。
今日は吉田拓郎さんの歴代の嫁さんと、その嫁との間に生まれた子供について書いてみたいと思います。
過去の奥さん達と離婚してしまった理由についても書いてみたいと思います。
吉田拓郎の結婚・離婚を時系列でまとめる。四角桂子、浅田美代子、森下愛子。 年代 結婚・離婚 1972年(26歳) 四角桂子と結婚 1974年(28歳) 四角桂子との間に娘「彩」誕生 1975年(29歳) 四角桂子と離婚 1977年(31歳) 浅田美代子と2度目の結婚 1984年(38歳) 浅田美代子と2度目の離婚 1986年(40歳) 森下愛子と3度目の結婚 吉田拓郎は過去に3度の結婚と2度の離婚。子供は初婚の相手に１人だけ誕生 吉田拓郎さんは１９７２年に四角佳子さんと結婚するも、１９７５年には離婚しています。
四角桂子さんとの結婚生活は3年でした。
１９７７年に浅田美代子さんと再婚するも、１９８４年には離婚しています。
浅田美代子さんとの結婚生活は７年でした。
１９８６年の４０歳の頃に結婚した森下愛子さんと現在までに結婚生活は続いています。
子供は初婚の四角桂子さんとの間に娘が一人生まれているだけです。
吉田拓郎と最初の嫁・四角桂子の馴れ初めと娘・彩。離婚理由は不倫と誤逮捕 吉田拓郎さんの最初の結婚は1972年の２６歳の頃で相手は歌手の四角桂子さんです。
２人の馴れ初めは１９７１年５月３０日に、愛知県岡崎で開催されたフォークグループ「六文銭」とのジョイントコンサートで、吉田さんは「広島フォーク村」というサークルの活動の中で、四角さんと知り合ったのです。
初めて会った時から、ほう、いい女だなあって思ったよ。だいたい俺は惚れっぽい性質だしね。でもちょっと小生意気な感じもしてね。
こういう感じの女は一発やんなきゃわからないって思ったんだよ。よし、いっちょチャンスを作ってやろうと狙いはつけたわけよ
フォーク歌手として出会った吉田拓郎と四角佳子さんですが、当時の吉田拓郎さんは売れる前でお金がなく、荒れた生活を送っていました。
四角さんの吉田さんの最初の印象は良くなかったようです。
ひと言でいえば、すご～くイヤ～な感じの男だってところかな。紹介されてもね。素足に運動靴をはいて、楽屋のテーブルの上に座ったまま足をブラブラさせながら、”アッ”とか”ヘッ”とか言うだけなの。
普通の人なら”よろしく“ぐらい、ちゃんと立って言いそうなものでしょう。それも相手はウラ若き乙女だったんだから・・・
吉田さんは四角さんが所属する六文銭と仕事する機会が多く、頻繁に顔を合わせるようになったそうです。
四角さんを狙っていた吉田さんは、仕事の用もなしにわざわざ六文銭の練習場に顔を出しては四角さんに話しかけてアピールしていたのだとか。
交際に発展したきっかけは酒癖が悪い吉田拓郎さんがケンカで負傷し、そんな彼を四角佳子が介抱したことがきっかけで恋仲になったそうです。
四角佳子さんは深夜営業しているスーパーを探して、ガーゼと絆創膏を購入し、泣きじゃくりながら介抱したといいます。
1年間の交際を経て1972年に結婚し、同年６月に軽井沢の聖パウロ教会で結婚式を挙げました。
結婚した当初、吉田拓郎さんは26歳で四角さんは20歳でした。
新婚生活は東京・高円寺の2DKのアパートでスタートさせましたが、当初から喧嘩ばかりだったそうです。
喧嘩の理由としては、食事の趣味が合わない、嫁はアウトドアだが吉田さんはインドア、亭主関白の吉田さんに対して四角さんも気が強いなど、価値観の全てが真逆だったことが影響していたそうです。
吉田さんは四角と結婚する前から性格が合わないことを知っていたそうですが、それよりも四角さんの女性としての魅力が勝ち、結婚に踏み切ったそうです。
名曲「結婚しようよ」は、最初の嫁の四角さんの為に作ったとされます。
離婚理由は不倫だけじゃない？吉田拓郎の誤認逮捕や音楽の成功で急に大金持ちに・・・ 吉田拓郎さんは最初の結婚生活の内に、次の嫁となる浅田美代子さんと不倫関係にあったと有名で、世間ではそれが離婚理由だと思われています。
しかし、実際には浅田さんとの不倫と離婚は関係なかったそうです。
吉田さんは離婚を発表した１９７５年９月のラジオで、
ぼくは決して女房は嫌いではない。好きな女なんだ。でも、暮らしていくのは耐えられない。
と、離婚を発表する際に、”好きな女”と強調しました。
実は、吉田さんの不倫以外にも、夫婦生活が崩壊する事件は多くありました。</description></item><item><title>Cazzie David - Height, Bio, Facts, In Relation, Age, Net Worth</title><link>/cazzie-david.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cazzie-david.html</guid><description>Table of Biography
