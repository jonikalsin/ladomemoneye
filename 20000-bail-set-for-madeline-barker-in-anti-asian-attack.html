Police say they caught the woman who pepper-sprayed four Asian women in an unprovoked, racist attack. Madeline Barker, 47, showed up to court Saturday, according to The New York Post.

That was when a stranger–Barker–cursed them out and used pepper spray on them completely unprovoked, they said. The situation started when she had her back to them while sitting on one of the large stones along 9th Avenue, they said. She claimed the women were trying to harass her, one of them said.</p><p>Another insisted thy were not trying to bother her.</p><p>One of them even offered an apology.</p><p>“Like I’m sorry, I didn’t intend to make you feel that way,” she said.</p><p>They started to record when she began going on a racist rant and took out pepper spray.</p><p>“Saying like, go back to where you came from, you don’t belong here,” one woman said. “She pointed to an Asian bystander who was a man, we didn’t know who he was, pointed at him and said take your [expletive] back to your country.”</p><p>One of the women said she could not open her eyes for about 30 minutes because of the pepper spray.</p><p>[Image via New York Police Department]</p><p>Have a tip we should know? <a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=582c31282b1834392f39363c3b2a31353d763b3735>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX2d9cXyPZpmaoZxiwKbAjJ%2Bmq2WdlrGmuMinnGaakae4pr6MoqVmmZ6ptm6t0qKYp2WRqcGir8po</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./terrell-owens-net-worth-the-unforgettable-legacy-of-an-nfl-legend.html><span>←</span><span>The Unforgettable Legacy of an NFL Legend The Talks Today</span></a>
