The Sandra Bullock movie, based on the life of NFL star <strong>Michael Oher</strong>, is a tearjerker. If you know him, then you might also have heard about <strong>Marcus Oher</strong>, who was thrust to fame because of his brother, Michael.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, Marcus is the biological half-brother of the famous footballer Michael. As one of twelve children, they share the same mother, <strong>Denise Oher</strong>.</p><h2>Marcus Oher Had A Difficult Childhood</h2><p>As a child of a single mother, Marcus Oher did not have it easy growing up. Marcus' childhood was particularly sad and tragic, filled with a drug-using mother, poverty, bad housing, and terrible foster care experiences. There were many instances where the family was broke and homeless.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/11/marcus%20(1)-min-1670742352253.jpg><p>Marcus, with his brother Michael, spent much of his time running to elude the CPS and the authorities. Denise was the only parent her kids had, but she was not a proper one.</p><h2>Parents: Who Is Marcus Oher's Biological Father?</h2><p>Marcus Oher goes by his mother's surname. But his biological father is <strong>Odell Watkins</strong>. He was part of a wayward gang that did drugs.&nbsp;</p><p>Marcus' mother, Denise Oher, grew up in an orphanage after the death of her father and the neglect of an alcoholic mother. This led to more problems as she later ran into a bad crowd and abused drugs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/11/denise%20(1)-min-1670741757823.jpg><p>Marcus's parents, Denise&nbsp;and Odell, were together for years, and they had five kids together. They later separated. Odell then tried to dispute paternity, but the paternity was confirmed through DNA testing. Not much is known about Odell after the breakup with Marcus's mother.</p><p>Later Denise's half-brother, Robert Faulkner, sent his friend from prison Michael Jerome Williams Sr., to check up on his sister. He fell into a relationship with her, and they had Michael Jr. After Michale Sr. went back to prison, the single mother Denise and her kids lived a life of upheavals and disorganization.</p><p>Michael Oher's back story is introduced in <i>The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game</i>, a Book by Michael Lewis. This book showcases a bleak past with some tragic memories. There are excerpts where Michael and his siblings, including Marcus Oher, were homeless, hiding, or living cramped, with 12 kids squeezed in a car.&nbsp;</p><h2>Marcus Oher Has Eleven Siblings&nbsp;</h2><p>Marcus Oher has many siblings, mostly from having the same mother. It is reported that he has <strong>four </strong>full siblings and <strong>seven </strong>half-siblings, all sharing the same mother. The most notable of his siblings is the famous NFL guard <a href=#><strong>Michael Oher</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Marcus's siblings, born from his mother, Denise Oher, are <a href=#><strong>Carlos Oher</strong></a>, Andre, John, Tara, Denise, Depitha, David, Rico, Deljuan, and Michael. Sources suggest that Deljuan Oher died in <strong>2007 </strong>in a car accident.</p><h2>Let's Learn A Little About Michael Oher</h2><p>The famous former Offensive tackle of the &nbsp;Baltimore Ravens, Marcus Oher, is one of the most relevant players of today. Though currently inactive in the NFL, his story is quite an inspiration for many young African Americans. His full name is <strong>Michael Jerome Williams, Jr</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Michael was born as the sixth child of Denis Oher. His father, <strong>Michael Jerome Williams, Sr.</strong>, died in prison when he was in high school. His childhood in the hoods of Tennessee was not a happy experience, and he was in and out of foster homes with his half-siblings.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/11/314413088_123825287171466_7609948369729411939_n%20(1)-min-1670741586160.jpg><p>The NFL star Michael would later live with <strong>Leigh Anne</strong> & <strong>Sean Tuohy</strong>, a Caucasian couple who would eventually adopt him. He became a star football player. In the <strong>2016 </strong>season, he was released from playing in the Panthers team due to a concussion. Michael&nbsp;apparently had to sit out from a lot of matches due to his injury.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, Marcus's&nbsp;brother Michael is married to his longtime girlfriend, <strong>Tiffany Roy</strong>. The pair wed in Marcus&nbsp;after seventeen years together. They have four kids together, sons <strong>Kobi </strong>and <strong>MJ </strong>and daughters <strong>Kierstin</strong> and <strong>Naivi</strong>.</p><h2>Where Is Marcus Oher's&nbsp;Mother Now?</h2><p>Marcus Oher's&nbsp;mother, Denise Oher, was arrested in <strong>2013 </strong>for DUI, disorderly conduct, and driving on a suspended license. She is currently out of prison. After staying in a public housing complex in Foote Homes, South City, Memphis, for several years, she later moved to a two-bedroom house on Elvis Presley Boulevard.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the positives is that Denise is now clean. She has stated that she was very embarrassed by her former drug habit and is very glad that her children have been successful. Apparently, some of her kids, including Michael, have helped her financially. &nbsp;She also has a strong belief in God and is a spiritual person.</p><h2>Net Worth & Earnings of Marcus Oher</h2><p>Marcus Oher is not an athlete like his sibling Michael but he is a businessman and owns a successful cleaning business. Marcus' net worth is estimated to be about<strong> $70 thousand</strong>, similar to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Cara Maria Sorbello</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/11/mivhael%20(1)-min-1670741935728.jpg><p>On the other hand, his famous brother, Michael Oher, has a massive fortune of <strong>$16 million</strong> successfully earned through his sports career. He also benefitted from the success of the book and movie <i>The Blind Side</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Some stories also state that he increased his fortune through his business. No doubt, he is one of the wealthiest NFL stars.</p><h2>Personal Life: Does Marcus Oher Have A Wife?&nbsp;</h2><p>Marcus Oher dropped out of school after the ninth grade. Sources report that he has at least one child. It is not known if he has a wife. He is the oldest of Denise's kids.&nbsp;</p><p>Oher has been in and out of foster homes and running from the authorities, such as CPS, since a very young age. Marcus was homeless when he was a child. When Michael was adopted by <a href=# rel=nofollow>Sean Tuohy</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Leigh Anne Tuohy</a>, he was already an adult.</p><h2>About The Blind Side</h2><p>The movie <i>Blind Side</i> narrates Marcus's celebrity brother Michael's life. Marcus is mentioned many times in the book of the same name. So it is evident that his presence was important. The same goes for this film, where Oher's character is portrayed very nicely.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Here in this film, Marcus is shown as very supportive and always ready to help Michael, whereas it is just opposite to his mother as she is pictured as the worst mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Denise is portrayed as an absent and neglectful mother, while Marcus and the older kids try to do their best with so many siblings. In the book, the kids' lives are explained in even more depth.</p><h3>Michael Oher Is Not Happy With Blind Side</h3><p>While many loved the book and the movie, Marcus Oher's brother, Michael Oher isn't one of them. Moreover, the former NFL star has been very vocal about his disdain for the movie and the book.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/9/6/Michael%20Oher%20photographed%20at%20this%20book%20signing%20event-1693981850110.jpg><p>The deal with Blind Side also caused a rift between Michael and his adoptive parents. Moreover, the NFL athlete shocked the world when he revealed he had made nothing from the movie based on his life. But the surprises don't end there!</p><p>In February 2023, Michael further shook the world. As it turns out, Sean Tuohy and Leigh Anne Tuohy didn't adopt Michael as their son. Moreover, Sean and Leigh signed a conservatorship that provided him with no familial relationship with the Tuohys.</p><p><i><strong>Check Out </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong> for more exciting celebrity bios</strong>.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqaYq5ulqHqwtMSr</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mia-hayward.html><span>←</span><span>Mia Hayward Wiki, Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
