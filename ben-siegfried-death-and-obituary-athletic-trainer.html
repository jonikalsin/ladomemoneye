The XFL revealed on Friday that Ben Siegfried, an employee of the athletic training department who worked with the D.C. Defenders and Battlehawks, passed away on Thursday night.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Ben Siegfried played a significant part in training the Battlehawks and D.C. Defenders for the XFL season while pursuing his graduate studies at Lebanon Valley College. He was a crucial component of the training group, and the units regarded and respected his services enormously.</p><p>Without a doubt, Ben Siegfried’s passing has left a big hole in both the Battlehawks’ organization and the XFL as a whole. He will be sadly missed and his enthusiasm, devotion, and hard work will always be remembered.</p><h2><span id=Battlehawks8217_athletic_trainer_Ben_Siegfried_was_found_dead>Battlehawks’ athletic trainer, Ben Siegfried, was found dead.</span></h2><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Battlehawks’ athletic trainer, Ben Siegfried, was found dead.</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Why Did Ben Siegfried Die and How Did He Die?</a><ul><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_2">2.1</span> Also Read: Tantoo Cardinal’s Wife, Kids, And Family</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>Since his team gave him a heartfelt tribute, there has been much discussion about Ben Siegfried’s passing.</p><p>The staff described how helpful and upbeat Ben Siegfried was in the tribute to his passing. They also said that they would all miss him.</p><p>The precise circumstances behind Ben Siegfried’s death have not been made public by the league. However, the Battlehawks and the XFL community have suffered greatly as a result of losing such a crucial training team member.</p><p>Despite the devastating news, the Battlehawks will play their first home game of the year on Sunday at the Dome at America’s Center against the Arlington Renegades. On March 18, the squad will play another home game at the same location against the D.C. Defenders.</p><p>Before the COVID-19 epidemic ended the 2020 season, which saw only five of ten games played, the league and the Battlehawks had a lot of support and interest from businesses and fans.</p><p>On April 13, 2022, the Battlehawks appointed Antony Becht, a former St. Louis Ram, as their head coach following the team’s maiden campaign. When the XFL confirmed the team’s return to St. Louis on July 24, 2022, it became clear that Becht would take the team’s reins for the 2023 season revival.</p><p>The Battlehawks are clearly going through a trying and emotional time in the wake of Ben Siegfried’s loss. They will nevertheless continue to commemorate his memory and work hard to succeed in the XFL.</p><h2><span id=Why_Did_Ben_Siegfried_Die_and_How_Did_He_Die>Why Did Ben Siegfried Die and How Did He Die?</span></h2><p>The death of one of their own, Ben Siegfried, a training staff member, at the team hotel on Thursday night saddened the St. Louis Battlehawks.</p><p>The squad needed the young man, who was in his early 20s, and his untimely passing has left the company and the XFL community in shock and sadness. His death’s cause has not yet been made public.</p><p>After the incident, the team decided to postpone morning meetings to give everyone time to absorb and grieve. However, despite having heavy hearts and a sense of loss permeating the room, the group proceeded their practice as planned.</p><p>On Saturday, the Battlehawks will play the Arlington Renegades in St. Louis, where they will likely play with heavy hearts as they pay tribute to Ben Siegfried’s memory. It is obvious that his passing has had a significant impact on the team, but they will come together and move on as they aim to succeed in the XFL.</p><h3><span id=Also_Read_Tantoo_Cardinal8217s_Wife_Kids_And_Family><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Tantoo Cardinal&#39;s Wife, Kids, And Family"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://superstarsculture.com/tantoo-cardinals-wife-kids-and-family/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/tantoo-cardinals-wife-kids-and-family/"}{"1":51}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Tantoo Cardinal’s Wife, Kids, And Family</a></span></span></h3><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>athletic trainer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Brian Jordan Alvarez: Is He Gay?
