They’ll go to Baha Mar, a seaside resort in the Bahamas.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Real-Housewives-of-Miami.jpg alt="Real Housewives of Miami" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>But what’s an RHOM trip without some drama? While the vacation begins on a positive one, with the stars having fun, relaxing, and pranking each other, things quickly turn sour. They all start arguing one by one, making the vacation seem serious and awkward.&nbsp;Alexia Nepola, Larsa Pippen, Guerdy Abraira, Dr. Nicole Martin, Julia Lemigova, and Lisa Hochstein return as prominent cast members for Real Housewives of Miami season 5.</p><p>Marysol Patton, Adriana De Moura, and Kiki Barth join them as supporting cast members and friends. The teaser also teases a visit from one of the series’ ultimate OGS, Lea Black, who attempts to get Lisa to swallow a bitter pill and accept the end of her marriage.</p><p>Lisa says in the trailer:</p><p>“My life changed in the flash of an eye; I’m losing my closest friend, I’m losing my spouse – to another woman.”</p><p>But that’s not all; the Real Housewives of Miami star will also lose a personal trainer who will dump her as a client to train Lenny’s new lover. Lisa urges her estranged husband, Lenny, not to allow his girlfriend approach their children during a heated phone call.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Real-Housewives-of-Miami-2.jpg alt="Real Housewives of Miami" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She continues:</p><p>“If you bring that female near my f****** children, there’s going to be a tremendous f****** issue, do you understand?”</p><p>Lisa said at BravoCon 2022 that her fellow RHOM cast members are like her sisters. She also said that she is not totally prepared to see the series since she does not recognize herself from six months ago. She also said at the Bravo event that going through the divorce, both personally and publicly “for the entire world to see,” was exceedingly painful.&nbsp;Watch the Real Housewives of Miami season 5 debut on Bravo on December 8 to find out what happens next.
