This was unexpected because the shape of the vessels suggested that they were used to contain and consume liquids,” Chinchilla told All That’s Interesting in an email.</p><p>He and his team tested the vessels for other substances like those present in cacao and chili peppers but their “analyses failed to detect the presence of any of these plant secondary metabolites in the samples.”</p><p>As Chinchilla told All That’s Interesting, the vessels are likely “archaeological evidence of consuming tobacco infusions.”</p><p>But for what purpose?</p><h2>How Ancient People Used Tobacco</h2><p>According to Chinchilla, the exact purpose of the “tobacco infusions” is unclear. “We cannot know whether they did it habitually or only in selected ceremonial occasions,” he told All That’s Interesting.</p><p>However, he noted that the latter is “more likely.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-477509 alt="Vessels Found At Cotzumalhuapa" width=800 height=982 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/uncovering-the-vessels.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-477509 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Antiquity</span><span class=caption-body>The vessels were first discovered between 2006 and 2007, but recent chemical analysis revealed unexpected traces of nicotine.</span></p><p>He and his co-authors wrote that nicotine is “toxic and potentially lethal” when consumed orally in high qualities. That’s why it’s often done during rituals, to “induce deep sleep, visions, and divinatory trances.”</p><p>In Cotzumalhuapa, researchers suspect that the tobacco may have been used during some kind of purification ritual.</p><p>“The proximity of sweat baths in the same architectural group as the cache deposits containing cylindrical vases at Cotzumalhuapa suggests that the tobacco infusions deposited in these vessels may have been employed in curing and purification rituals,” the study explains.</p><p>Their study further notes that the consumption of tobacco in liquid form is “not the most common method of use throughout the Americas,” but it has been documented before in the Amazon and the Guianas. Other Mesoamerican cultures used tobacco to communicate with spirits, diagnose disease, and achieve fearlessness during sacrifices. But though tobacco was important to ancient cultures, it’s scarce within the archaeological record.</p><p>“[O]nly one vessel from the Maya area (an unprovenienced flask lacking exact known archaeological origin) had previously tested positive for nicotine in residue analysis,” Chinchilla told All That’s Interesting. “Future work may reveal similar results at other sites. At present, we cannot tell whether this use of tobacco was widespread.”</p><p>Moving forward, he and his co-authors are eager to learn more about “ritual life” in Cotzumalhuapa itself. As Chinchilla told All That’s Interesting, it was one of Mesoamerica’s “greatest cities” in the Late Classic period (650 C.E. to 950 C.E.) and a place where art and culture thrived. So, what were its rituals like? Archaeologists are hoping to learn more soon.</p><p>After reading about the ceramic vessels discovered in Guatemala with traces of tobacco, discover the story of <a href=#>Camazotz</a>, the ancient Maya god known as the “Death Bat.” Or, look through these stunning <a href=#>photos of South and Central America</a> taken by explorers in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyku9OzrKaZnJ3CorzAZquompGYsLA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katherine-young-obituary-ri-smithfield-high-school-music-teacher-passed-away.html><span>←</span><span>Katherine Young obituary ri, Smithfield High School music teacher passed away</span></a>
