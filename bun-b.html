He first released a demo tape called “Underground King” that didn’t include Bun B. Alternatively, it included Mitchell Queen, a buddy of Pimp C’s. Bun and his friend Jalon Jackson formed P.A. Militia, which was their own band. The two organizations merged to form the 4 Black Ministers group.<br>Later, Queen and Jackson quit the group, leaving Pimp C and Bun B, who decided to rejoin UGK. Underground King, a demo Pimp C recorded with Mitchell Queen, caught the attention of Bigtyme Records, a Houston-based independent label. They then published The Southern Way, an extended play.<br>Jive Records took notice of this album when it was released. Many of the songs on their debut album, Too Hard to Swallow, had content that was too explicit for the album, therefore Bigtyme Records published an extended play named Banned, which included all of the songs that were too explicit for Too Hard to Swallow, before the album was released. The song “Pocket Full of Stones” was the first by UGK to receive widespread exposure in the United States. In 1994, they released their second album, Super Tight… Ridin’ Dirty, their third album, reached number two on the R&B charts and number 15 on the Billboard 200 in 1996. Pimp C was sentenced to prison after releasing their fourth studio album, Dirty Money.<br>In January 2014, Bun B announced “The Trillest Tour.” On January 30, the Houston native announced his tour dates, which he would be joined by Kirko Bangz, another Houston native. From March 6 through April 17, 2014, the tour was on the road.<br>Aside from music, he and author Shea Serrano collaborated on a coloring book named “Bun B’s Rap Coloring Book” in 2013. Freeman and Serrano have previously discussed collaborating on a book. Initially, they intended to collaborate on a “hip hop survival guide,” but they later decided against it. Serrano later drew and released coloring pages of rappers on Tumblr. The pages rapidly became popular.
