She donned a black leather bra-top with a lace-up front and matching pants with open sides that laced up from her ankles all the way to her belt. Even in her dress rehearsal for the big show, Miley was embracing her rock ‘n roll aesthetic.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Miley fully embraced being a rock star for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her new album Plastic Hearts</a>, which became her first entry into Billboard‘s Rock Albums chart territory. After killing it in the world of pop music and even forays into country, Plastic Hearts debuted at number one on the rock album chart on Dec. 12, 2020. Not a bad way to end the year for Miley, who is quickly becoming the queen of reinventing herself. We can’t wait to see what she has in store for 2021.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>Miley didn’t take part in the New York City festivities for the special, which were highly limited due to crowd restrictions in Times Square and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>strict COVID-19 protocols</a> for all of the performances. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a> headlined the night from Times Square. Also out of New York, <strong>Machine Gun Kelly</strong> and <strong>Jimmie Allen</strong> held their performances, while <strong>Billy Porter</strong>&nbsp;not only co-hosted hosted with Ryan, but reunited with pal <strong>Cyndi Lauper</strong> for a duet. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the New Year’s Eve ball celebration in Times Square went virtual for the first time in its 114-year history.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>With several time zones to cover as 2021 rolled in and an 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT start time for Dick Clark’s New Years Rockin’ Eve, producers promised a whopping five and a half hours of performances. In addition to Miley, JLo and MGK there were plenty of other artists lending their talents to the special, including <strong>Megan Thee Stallion</strong>, <strong>Doja Cat</strong>,<strong> Maluma</strong>, <strong>Nelly</strong>, <strong>Lewis Capaldi</strong>, <strong>En Vogue</strong>, <strong>Ella Mai</strong>, and<strong> Brandy</strong>. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ciara</strong></a> got to ring in New Year’s on the West Coast, hosting the show for the fourth year out of Los Angeles and helping celebrate as the clock struck midnight in the Pacific Time Zone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ze5JqZqahnJrGbq%2FYq6ysZZ6axG7FxJqprGWVq7Jufo9raGanpamzqsCMqZyrnp%2BnuqK6wp5kqaCfqby0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-barnett-sexuality-is-he-gay-explore-his-relationship-and-family.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Barnett Sexuality | Is He Gay | Explore His Relationship And Family</span></a>
