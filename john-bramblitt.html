Bramblitt started out using a special kind of fabric paint with raised edges, which enabled him to feel the shapes he was making. His artistic abilities only grew from that point on.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Umbrella Single" width=750 height=609 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/John-Bramblitt-umbrella-single.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><img decoding=async alt="John Bramblitt Art" width=750 height=591 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/John-Bramblitt-deer-close-stream.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>John Bramblitt has found solutions to the many obstacles he faces as a blind painter, namely the ability to determine paint placement on the canvas and create the correct hues. “Basically what I do is replace everything that the eyes would do for a sighted artist with the sense of touch,” he explains. As far as color goes, “All of the bottles and paint tubes in my studio are Brailled, and when mixing colors I use recipes… I will measure out different portions of each color that I need to produce the right hue. This is no different than using a recipe to bake a cake.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-45357 alt="duck photograph" width=750 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/John-Bramblitt-ducks.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-45357 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Bored Panda</a></p><p><img decoding=async alt="john bramblitt deer" width=750 height=602 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/John-Bramblitt-deer.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>With oil paints, the textures vary enough that Bramblitt can decipher white from black by touch; white is thicker like toothpaste, and black is thinner. These textures guide Bramblitt as if they were Braille upon the canvas, letting him know exactly where each color is placed in relation to the rest.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-45354 alt="john bramblitt sailboat close" width=750 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/John-Bramblitt-sailboat-close.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-45354 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Bored Panda</a></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-45353 alt="john bramblitt crowd" width=750 height=503 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/John-Bramblitt-crowd.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-45353 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Bored Panda</a></p><p>At his first art show, John Bramblitt didn’t mention to anyone that he was blind.
