<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Milana Vayntrub Opens Up About Abortion</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Milana Vayntrub is a Soviet-born American actress, comedian, and activist. She started her career as a child actress after immigrating to the United States.&nbsp;<span>She came a long way from suffering from financial issues to having a successful career in America.</span></span></p><p><span>With her jaw-breaking acting skills, Milana has become a well-recognized and respected actress, comedian, and model today, coming from an immigrated family from Uzbek, Soviet.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Opens Up About Abortion</span></strong></h2><p><span>Milana Vayntrub wrote her <a href=# rel=noopener>abortion story</a> in an essay for The Daily Beast, explaining how access to abortion should be a privilege but should be a protected right. Her main point for the essay was to encourage others to support reproductive rights in the US, and she also shared her own story of getting an abortion ten years ago.</span></p><p><span>Milana shared that she immediately knew the right thing to do when she found out that she was pregnant after missing birth control. She explained that she was living with her boyfriend in an apartment that they could barely afford and had worked a series of jobs at the time. So, she decided on getting an abortion with no handwringing, no sleepless nights, and said that her moral compass was directed toward not bringing a child into the world.</span></p><p><span>However, the actress explained she was able to give birth to her first child last year because she had chosen it. Thus, all nausea, pain, and expenses of finances and emotions of pregnancy became bearable only because she chose to give birth.</span></p><p><span>Milana also referenced efforts made by abortion-rights opponents in the US and mentioned the Women's Health Protection Act which proposed legislation to protect the right to access abortion care. She called out all the senators and urged them to pass the Women's Health Protection Act and hoped for them to join her.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is She Married Or Pregnant?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Milana Vayntrub was in a short-lived relationship with famous singer John Mayer back in 2006 when she was only 19 years old, and John Mayer was 28 years old. Their relationship lasted for almost a year, and John moved on from her to date several other celebrities.</span></p><p><span>After their breakup, Milana has remained low key about her relationships and shared that she longed for a loving and caring husband who could cook as she sucked at cooking. She shared her concern about introducing her boyfriend to her fans rather than to her parents. However, many even speculated that she might be a lesbian.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She prefers to have a low-key love life that proves her as a private person. She has managed to keep her relationships a secret from the media and the internet. Many even claimed that she has remained single for most of her life and only had one relationship where she didn't get to be engaged.</span></p><p><span>She was also involved in fake pregnancy rumors that spread when her commercials were out. The sources confirmed that she was not pregnant, and the actress herself has tweeted about the comments she received about her body in the commercials.</span></p><p><span>However, the actress loved to post photos of little kids on her Instagram account so people could get confused too. But there has been no confirmation on whether she has a daughter.</span></p><h2><strong><span>How Much Is Milana Vayntrub Net Worth?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Milana Vayntrub has a <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of $3 million.</span></p><p><span>Milana studied at Beverly Hills High School but dropped out and got a GED, and graduated from the University of California, San Diego, with a BA in communication degree.
