He faces 10 years to life in prison on those counts.</p><p>According to the New York Post, Bonjean wrote to federal Judge Ann Donnelly saying she was concerned that Kelly’s potential testimony to a mitigation expert for sentencing could be used against him in Illinois.</p><p>Prosecutors wrote on Monday, however, that Bonjean’s argument was nothing more than “speculative concern” and that it “strains credibility that [Kelly] would say anything to a potential mitigation expert that would incriminate him” in Illinois.</p><p>The prosecutors also said they would not share any such testimony with prosecutors in Illinois and “would welcome a court order further prohibiting any such disclosure.”</p><p><strong>For the latest true crime and justice news,&nbsp;subscribe to the ‘Crime Stories with Nancy Grace’ podcast.</strong></p><p>[Featured image: R.
