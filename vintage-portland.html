Two years later, a coin toss decided that the city would be called “Portland” instead of “Boston,” and the rest is history.</p><p>Following the toss, a number of events would help form one of America’s coolest cities. In 1879, Portland’s first telephone lines were installed. Almost fifty years later in 1912, the city’s first rose garden was established, giving the Portland its official nickname: the Rose City.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-46091 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/vintage-portland-1905.jpg alt="Portland In 1905" width=800 height=515 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-46091 class=wp-caption-text>The Portland Harbor circa 1905.</p><p>In the 1940s, both the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) and World War II brought about much change. Congress created the BPA to market and transmit power from Portland’s Bonneville Dam, which lies on the border between Oregon and Washington.</p><p>The city was given 2 billion dollars to fund the project, creating a massive amount of jobs. Coupled with the increased demand for war goods, Portland quickly swelled to an economically robust U.S. city with limitless opportunity.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="Vintage Portland Pictures" width=800 height=542 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/vintage-portland1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Portland also welcomed rapid growth in the late 20th century following the dot-com boom.</p><p>While the city boasted a number of tech jobs — along with positions at big-name companies like Nike and Adidas — it offered a cheaper cost of living, lush landscapes and urban growth boundaries. People were hooked. Now, Portland is a major international port, with more than 600,000 people calling the city home. But before it became a beer-and-barista heaven, vintage Portland looked like this:</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>Portland just two years after it was officially incorporated as a city.</span> <span class=caption-body>Mt.
