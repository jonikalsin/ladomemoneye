Filmmakers created the part of the genie for <a href=#>Robin Williams</a>‘ talents.</p><p>“[Co-writer and co-director] John Musker and I wrote the original script with the specific idea that Robin would voice the genie and that he would be a visual as well as vocal shape-shifter. Robin would be encouraged to improvise to his heart’s content,” Clements explained.</p><p>Williams nailed the part, recording a wealth of material during multiple four-hour sessions. After each, he was “dripping with sweat, completely drained,” Clements said. He added, “To this day, it’s one of the most incredible vocal sessions I’ve ever witnessed.”</p><h2 id=h-disney-s-aladdin-animator-used-mc-hammer-videos-to-capture-the-motions-of-the-character-s-parachute-pants>Disney’s ‘Aladdin’ animator used MC Hammer videos to capture the motions of the character’s parachute pants</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>According to character animator Glen Keane, inspiration came from a few different sources when he drew Aladdin. “I originally was thinking of him like a Michael J. Fox character, short in stature but with a big ego and lots of dreams,” Keane told the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Los Angeles Times</a>.</p><p>But after watching <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> in Top Gun, he decided to use his look. “In all [Cruise’s] poses, I noticed there was a confidence, a look in the eyebrows, that gives him intensity and at the same time a smile that has kind of an impish look, like he’s got something up his sleeve,” Keane explained.</p><p>However, Aladdin’s clothes were very dissimilar to what Cruise wore in Top Gun. So, animators reportedly turned to “U Can’t Touch This” rapper <a href=#>MC Hammer</a>‘s music videos as a reference. That’s how they captured the movement of Aladdin’s parachute pants (per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BuzzFeed</a>).</p><h2 id=h-some-scholars-think-a-real-person-inspired-the-disney-character-of-aladdin>Some scholars think a real person inspired the Disney character of Aladdin</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The story of Aladdin seemingly originated with a Syrian storyteller who spoke to Antoine Galland. Galland notably translated One&nbsp;Thousand and One Nights,&nbsp;or&nbsp;Arabian Nights, centuries ago. He wrote about his experience with the traveler in his diary (per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TIME</a>).</p><p>Some experts believe that Galland’s storyteller, Hanna Diyab from Aleppo, told <a href=#>his true story as Aladdin</a>. He would have described to Galland the marvels of the Palace of Versailles in France at the time.</p><p>Author Paulo Lemos Horta explained to TIME, “Diyab was ideally placed to embody the overlapping world of East and West, blending the storytelling traditions of his homeland with his youthful observations of the wonder of 18th-century France.”</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>Which Stars Voiced the Characters in Disney’s ‘Aladdin’?</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOrZ%2Biq12esLC6yJxkq5mgpbKzedaaqmahnqi9qr7AraCopl2bvLN506GcZqifpcKtrdFmm6KrnprGbq%2FHmqmam6Sav3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-inaugural-sauce-boyz-fests-draw-sell-out-crowds-in-puerto-rico.html><span>←</span><span>The Inaugural Sauce Boyz Fests Draw Sell-Out Crowds In Puerto Rico</span></a>
