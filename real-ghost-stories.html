Some believe this gives it dark energy.</span></p><p>The inn formerly housed slaves and workers who built the nearby St. Mary’s Church. Streams on the inn’s grounds <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had to be rerouted</a> around the church’s site, and many believe this diversion of water is in part responsible for exposing the area to dark energy.</p><p>As if that wasn’t enough, the inn is also purportedly haunted by a witch who sought shelter there before being caught and murdered. She was burned at the stake in the 1500s and is now said to haunt the room she once stayed in, aptly called “The Witch’s Room.”</p><p>The inn’s sole owner and occupant, John Humphries, claims he was first introduced to the inn’s noncorporeal occupants on his first night as its owner in 1968. He said he had just gone to sleep when a demonic presence ripped him out of bed by his arm and pulled him across the room.</p>John Humphries discusses the stories of hauntings associated with the inn.<p>Now in his 80s, he’s committed the rest of his life to maintaining the inn rather than running away from it — which most of us probably would’ve done half a century ago. Perhaps most depressing is the fact that Humphries’ wife and three daughters decided to do just that, leaving him alone on the property.</p><p>Humphries also claims to have found evidence of ritual sacrifice and devil worship underneath the staircase where he reportedly saw children’s bones punctured with daggers.</p><p>If any of these reports are true, then it is perhaps Humphries’ unwillingness to leave the inn that is truly the terrifying part of this ghost story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyzscClZKCgn6jBbr%2FTqKminaNkgg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./billy-garland-wikipedia.html><span>←</span><span>Billy Garlan: Rising Star Making Waves in 2023</span></a>
