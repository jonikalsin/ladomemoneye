However, recent injury concerns have raised questions about his future as a pitcher. In this article, we will explore the potential reasons why it might make sense to consider selling your <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shohei Ohtani</a> baseball cards if he stops pitching and focus solely on his offensive prowess. This leads to the question, "Is now the time to sell my <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shohei Ohtani Cards?</a>"</p><p><strong>Temporary Halt in Pitching Career:</strong><br data-mce-fragment=1>Shohei Ohtani's recent injury, a torn elbow ligament, has put a temporary halt to his pitching career for a year or two. While this setback may not negatively impact his popularity or card values, it does raise concerns about his long-term pitching potential. Selling his baseball cards soon after his injury might be a strategic move to capitalize on his current popularity before any potential decline in value.</p><p><strong>Impressive Performance as a Designated Hitter</strong><br data-mce-fragment=1>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ohtani's</a> pitching might be on hold, his performance as a designated hitter has been nothing short of outstanding. Offensively, he is leading in various statistics and is among the top players in the game. His consistent offensive output and popularity make him a valuable asset in the card market. By focusing on his offensive abilities, collectors can still benefit from his stellar performance even if he stops pitching.</p><p><strong>Popularity and Demand</strong><br data-mce-fragment=1>Shohei Ohtani is currently the most popular baseball player in the world, surpassing even Ichiro's popularity in Japan. His popularity spans across both Japan and the United States, making his rookie cards highly sought after. Despite his injury, collectors are still actively buying Ohtani's baseball cards, indicating the sustained demand for his cards. Selling his cards soon after he stops pitching may allow collectors to take advantage of the ongoing popularity and demand.</p><p><strong>Potential Impact on Card Values</strong><br data-mce-fragment=1>If Shohei Ohtani opts for a second Tommy John surgery and is unable to pitch in 2024, there is a possibility that his market value may decrease by approximately 50%. Although his cards would still hold significant value, this potential decline would signify a decrease from his current estimated worth.</p><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>Geoff Wilson, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"The Sports Card Investor"</a>, has frequently emphasized the strategy of selling when a player is in high demand and buying when their popularity diminishes. This approach is commonly practiced by investors across various assets, including stocks, which was famously popularized by legendary investor Warren Buffett.</p><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>By selling his cards at the peak of his popularity, collectors can maximize their returns before any potential decline in value due to the absence of pitching performances.</p><p><br data-mce-fragment=1><strong>Signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers</strong><br data-mce-fragment=1>The injury did not stop the Los Angeles Dodgers from signing Shohei Ohtani to a 700 Million Dollar contract. This scenario could impact the demand and value of his baseball cards and could lead to a increase in demand considering he is going to a larger market in Los Angeles compared to Anaheim. If Ohtani continues to pitch with the Dodgers and does not focus solely on his offensive abilities, his popularity and performance may continue to soar, further boosting the value of his cards.</p><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>While Shohei Ohtani's recent injury raises concerns about his pitching career, his exceptional offensive abilities and continued popularity make him an attractive asset in the card market. Selling his baseball cards soon after he stops pitching might be a strategic move to capitalize on his current popularity and demand. By focusing on his offensive prowess, collectors can still benefit from his impressive performance and maximize their returns before any potential decline in value. However, it is important to carefully consider market trends and expert opinions before making any selling decisions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miqqaeiqcBur8Crm6xnpJ2ybrzOrZynrJmWuW64zqCgnGWSmrWqusNmqp6knJ67qHnSoaahnZlivKnAwKegZpqRqLKjrculZJyZopnAbrXFZp%2BeZaOpvLG%2FjKmgrZuYnruo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robin-van-persie.html><span>←</span><span>Robin van Persie</span></a>
