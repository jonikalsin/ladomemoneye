<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit Review</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>I try to take pretty good <a class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>care of my teeth</a>, both because I get cavities pretty easily and because that’s just what you’re supposed to do, people. I brush at least twice a day, floss at least four or five times a week, I use a tongue scraper (gross, I know, but effective and so oddly satisfying) and fluoride-rich mouth wash. But being in my late 30s, a daily coffee drinker, and someone who often eats food, my teeth, while hardly stained or flaxen, are not always as bright white as I’d like.</p><p>There are a lot of <a class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#>at-home teeth whitening kits</a> that use the same basic approach here, if we’re being frank. That approach is one brushing his or her teeth and then applying a gel to a soft mouthguard-like piece, then gently biting down on that mouthguard after connecting it via cable to your phone’s charging port, which powers on a bank of blue lights that activate that gel formula. Fifteen minutes later and the process is done. What sets <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Laughland</a> apart? It’s the fact that the gel you’ll be using was formulated just for you.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1152,w_2048,x_0,y_685/dpr_2.0/c_limit,h_251/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1652138073/laughland_at_home_teeth_whitening_kit_review_bjoj6p style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>You can get a <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel=noopener>teeth whitening kit</a> for just $9 (usually $100) right now during Laughland’s epic anniversary sale.</p><p>Before you order a <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Laughland tooth whitening kit </a>(or a little to-go pen for teeth whitening on the go— can’t ever be too bright and shiny for that interview or reunion or whatnot, right), you complete a survey. It asks questions like “how often do you brush your teeth daily?” and “how sensitive are your teeth?” and it includes a selection of tooth shades from which you select one that most closely matches your current dental hue.</p><p>With the help of some behind-the-scenes algorithmic work, <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=# rel="sponsored noopener">Laughland</a> then recommends a formula just for you. I can tell you that the one selected for me produced visible and lasting results after just two treatments spread a day apart from one another. And now a few weeks on, my teeth are still whiter. So I’d call that a half-hour well-spent, and one I’ll spend again every couple of months.</p><p><a class="TrackingLink LinkWrapper" href=#><i>Scouted</i></a><i> selects products independently and prices reflect what was available at the time of publish.
