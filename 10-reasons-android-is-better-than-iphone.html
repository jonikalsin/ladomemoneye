10. Split Screen Option 
As an iPhone user, you may argue on this because your phone allows you to multitask by simply going back and forth from one application to the other."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

While Android users argue that their choice beats iPhone users, iOS users argue the same about their choices.</p><p>In this article, we agree that android is better than iPhone and we’ll give 10 distinct reasons for our choice. Here we go!</p><h2>10. Split Screen Option</h2><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Split-Screen-Why-android-is-better-than-iPhone.webp alt="Split Screen- Why android is better than iPhone" width=1260 height=800 sizes="(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>As an iPhone user, you may argue on this because your phone allows you to multitask by simply going back and forth from one application to the other. Android phones, on the other hand, have the ability to do different things at once (on the same screen).</p><p>With the “Split Screen” option introduced some years ago, android users can chat on social media and watch their favorite movie on their phone at the same time. This option is available to different brands of android phones like Samsung and <a href=# rel=noopener>Oppo</a>.</p><h2>9. Flexible Customizations</h2><p>Does iPhone allow for any form of customization at all? While Android users can customize their own keyboards, live wallpapers, and even more complex things like hardware, iPhone is more rigid in the way it is made. Having an iPhone is next to being restricted like a toddler beside a fireplace.</p><p>Apple typically stays in control of default apps so as to maintain a homogeneous software and hardware experience.</p><p>Home screens on android can equally be customized just the way you like them- you can place your apps anywhere you want. Both phones however allow you to create folders containing a list of apps- something to boast of?</p><h2>8. Varied Choices</h2><p>Android provides a <a href=# rel=noopener>variety of phones to choose from</a>. Apple has released a total of 34 iPhones over the years while there are currently over 24,000 distinct android devices from about 1,300 brands in the world.</p><p>This gives Android users more options to choose from while iPhone users have 34 options to choose from (at least for now. Feel better?).&nbsp;Android users can buy devices that fit their budget and taste and there are many brands in the world to consider.</p><h2>7. Type-C Charging Port (Fast Charging)</h2><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Type-C-Charging-Port.jpg alt="Type C Charging Port" width=976 height=549 sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Android has recently shifted to a more modern and reliable USB port (Type-C port). Type-C is supported by all laptop types (including Apple), however, iPhones still use lightning cables in 2022!</p><p>The fast-charge feature available as a result of the Type-C is equally fascinating. Your Samsung phone can literally go from 1 percent to 60 in less than 20 minutes. How much percent can an iPhone X charge in that time?&nbsp;</p><p>Needless to say, Apple no longer includes a charger in its new phones.</p><h2>6. Affordability</h2><p>Of course, Android phones are cheaper than <a href=# rel=noopener>iPhones </a>by far. The price advantage Android has over iPhone is one of its most notable selling points. While there are lots of android selections to choose from over a broad price range, iPhone has limited options at more costly rates.</p><h2>5. Expandable Memory</h2><p>Many Android smartphones include a slot for SD cards to allow for more storage space, unlike the iPhone which has a fixed storage space. Increasing storage on your phone can be very costly, so the SD card option solves this problem.</p><p>The amount of money spent on getting SD cards is quite meager compared to the amount spent upgrading your storage space on your Android or iOS device. Google Drive is another option for Android users- it comes with a free 15GB storage space while iPhone users can partake of this goodness on iCloud even though it is slashed into three (iPhones have only 5GB memory allocation on iCloud).</p><h2>4. Headphone Jack</h2><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rnn.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Headphone-Jacks-for-android-vs-iPhone.webp alt="Headphone Jacks for android vs iPhone" width=1200 height=800 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Newer iPhones (since the iPhone 7) do not have the ability to connect standard headphones to your device. To listen to music on your iPhone device, you may have to use a dongle or connect your Bluetooth headphone or get a wired one that allows the iPhone proprietary Lightning connector.</p><p>Android phones, on the other hand, have a headphone jack that allows you to connect a standard headphone to your device.</p><h2>3. Launcher</h2><p>This feature is another reason why android is better than iPhone. A launcher typically replaces your device’s start screen and makes changes to its operating system without rooting your phone.</p><p>Launchers are available for download on Google Play and are mostly free. By downloading any of these applications, an android user can personalize their phone’s appearance and behavior in many ways.</p><h2>2. Back Button</h2><p>Android has a physical back button that enables users to go from one application to the other easily, You could literally return to an application if you mistakingly move to another one by just clicking your back button.</p><p>For iPhone users, however, there is no back button; you could however just click on the in-app back buttons or the “back” options that appear when you move from one app to the other.</p><h2>1. Login Options</h2><p>iPhones use Touch ID fingerprint recognition to enable users to log in using just one touch. iPhone X also offers facial recognition but no retina or fingerprint recognition. iPhone on the other hand provides users with a variety of options. The most recent Samsung Galaxy phones for example allow users to choose their preferred mode of authentication (fingerprint, retina, or facial recognition).</p><h2>10 Reasons Why Android is Better than iPhone (Summary)</h2><p>In this article, we have highlighted the top 10 reasons why an android phone may be a better choice than an iPhone.
