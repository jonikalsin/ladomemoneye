For decades, my parents have chased leads, hiring their own labs and investigators. And yet, these DNA tests, which are available to anyone, helped us find our lost loved one.”</p><p>As the Fort-Worth Star-Telegram reports, Melissa’s father, Jeffrie, submitted his DNA to the genealogy service 23andMe. The company found that Jeffrie had three grandchildren born to a woman named Melanie Brown. When the Highsmith family realized that Brown had the same birthmark as Melissa, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>ABC News 4</a>, they knew that they’d found Melissa.</p><p>“They said ‘Dad, she’s alive,’ and I started crying,” Jeffrie told <a href=# rel=noopener>CBS News</a>. “[A]fter 51 years, it’s so emotional.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-411144 alt="Melissa Highsmith And Father" width=600 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/melissa-highsmith-and-father.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-411144 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>WE FOUND MELISSA!!!/Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>Melissa Highsmith and her father, Jeffrie.</span></p><p>As <a href=# rel=noopener>Fox News</a> reports, Melissa Highsmith went missing in 1971 after her mother, Atla Apantencl, hired a new babysitter. Apantencl, recently separated from Melissa’s father and working as a waitress in Fort Worth, placed an ad in a local newspaper for a babysitter. She was contacted by a woman who promised to come to the restaurant for an interview but never showed.</p><p>However, the woman called Apantencl later and reiterated her interest in the job, claiming she had a big yard and cared for multiple other children. Apantencl hired her, and agreed to let her pick up 22-month-old Melissa from her roommate while Apantencl was at work.</p><p>The babysitter disappeared with Apantencl’s baby — and the Highsmith family launched a five-decade search to bring Melissa Highsmith home.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-411321 alt="Melissa Highsmith As A Baby" width=350 height=485 data-sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/melissa-highsmith-as-a-baby.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-411321 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>WE FOUND MELISSA!!!/Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>Melissa Highsmith was 22 months old when her new babysitter kidnapped her.</span></p><p>“My mom did the best she could with the limited resources she had,” Sharon Highsmith said, according to the Fort-Worth Star-Telegram. “She couldn’t risk getting fired. So, she trusted the person who said they’d care for her child. For 50 years, my mom has lived with the guilt of losing Melissa.”</p><p>She added: “I’m so glad we have Melissa back. I’m also grateful we have vindication for my mom.”</p><p>As CBS News reports, Melissa Highsmith, now 53, was reunited with her parents and siblings in November 2022 — for the first time in five decades.</p><p>“It’s overwhelming, but at the same time, it’s the most wonderful feeling in the world,” Melissa said, according to CBS News. Adding that she’d thought it was a scam when Jeffrie first reached out to her over Facebook, she explained: “My father texted me on [Facebook] Messenger and he told me, ‘You know, I’ve been looking for my daughter for 51 years.'”</p><p>Since then, Melissa’s family members have expressed their utter joy at having her back in their lives.</p><p>“We had coffee with her on Thanksgiving night, and when I looked at her, I just knew. I knew,” Jeff Highsmith, Melissa’s brother said according to Fox News. He added that he “couldn’t take” his eyes off Melissa because she looked “just like” his mother.</p><p>For her part, Melissa’s mother is still overwhelmed by Melissa’s recovery.</p><p>“I just couldn’t believe it,” she said according to CBS News. “I thought I’d never see her again.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-411139 alt="Melissa Highsmith And Mother" width=600 height=959 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/melissa-highsmith-and-mother.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-411139 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>WE FOUND MELISSA!!!/Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>Melissa Highsmith and her mother, Atla Apantencl, embrace after five decades apart.</span></p><p>For now, not much is known about Melissa’s kidnapper. Fox News reports that Apantencl’s roommate told police that the kidnapper wore white gloves, sunglasses, and a bonnet, even though it was a hot August day. However, Melissa implied that her kidnapper had raised her after taking her in 1971.</p><p>“The person that raised me, I asked her, ‘Is there anything you need to tell me?’ and it was confirmed that she knew that I was baby Melissa so that just made it real,” Melissa explained to CBS News.</p><p>Though the story is still developing, Melissa Highsmith is overjoyed at being reunited with her biological family. She even plans to change her name back from Melanie to Melissa.</p><p>“My heart right now is just full and bursting with just so much emotion,” she told CBS News. “I’m just really, really happy.”</p><p>After reading about Melissa Highsmith, see how investigators used a minuscule DNA sample to solve the 1989 murder of 14-year-old <a href=#>Stephanie Isaacson.</a> Or, learn how police were able to use DNA to charge <a href=#>Robert John Lanoue</a> with the 1982 murder of five-year-old Anne Pham.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyuscuiqqyZXZ22qLTSpqCtoA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-taqueria-with-1950s-speakeasy-vibes-debuts-in-bostons-seaport-district.html><span>←</span><span>New Taqueria With 1950s Speakeasy Vibes Debuts In Boston's Seaport District</span></a>
