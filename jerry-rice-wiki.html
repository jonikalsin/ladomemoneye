He is most remembered for his three championship-winning seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, but he also played for the Oakland Raiders and Seattle Seahawks twice more toward the end of his career. Rice, who went by the nickname “World,” is widely regarded as the greatest wide receiver in NFL history and one of the greatest players of all time. This is largely due to his exceptional catching ability, accomplishments, and numerous records.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jerry_Rice_Wiki></span><span><strong>Jerry Rice Wiki</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Rice played four seasons of college football for the Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils, breaking numerous NCAA and team receiving records along the way. He also became the all-time leader in NCAA receiving touchdowns. The 16th overall pick in the 1985 draught, he signed with the 49ers. Following a mediocre rookie campaign, Rice broke out the following year as one of the top receivers in the game, four times leading the NFL in receiving yards and touchdowns.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/latestinbollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jerry-rice-1.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents></span><span><strong>Parents</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The sixth of eight children, Jerry Lee Rice was born on October 13, 1962, in Starkville, Mississippi. He was raised nearby in Crawford, Mississippi. Crawford had a population of just 600 people. Joe, Rice’s father, worked multiple jobs to support the family while also building homes out of bricks by hand. Rice referred to Joe as “a stern man” who enforced strict rules on him and his siblings. Mother of Rice, Eddie B., cleaned wealthy families’ homes after Rice left while Joe was at work raising Rice. In order to ensure that their father had bricks to lay, Rice and his brothers frequently assisted their father in building houses. They would catch bricks on top of scaffolds.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/latestinbollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jerry-rice-2.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Education></span><span><strong>Education</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Rice attended Oktoc, Mississippi’s B.

His 40-yard sprint time, which was estimated to be between 4.45 and 4.71 seconds, varies between sources. The San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys both shown interest in him. Before the draught, San Francisco had triumphed in two of the previous four Super Bowls. Rice later admitted in Go Long! that he would “often play head games” with himself and wasn’t sure how successful he would be in the NFL, in case things didn’t work out, he had electronics repair as a fallback.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/latestinbollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/jerry-rice-career.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Relationship></span><span><strong>Relationship</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>On September 8, 1987, Rice wed Jacqueline Bernice Mitchell.
